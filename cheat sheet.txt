db == database; use the name of the database you query

collection == collection of documents; can also use name of collection you're
querying

generic == db.collection.method()

If your database is books and your collection is george_orwell, you would do:
  
  books.orwell.method

Here are some CRUD methods:

use db // creates database with name db if it doesn't already exist

db.collection.insertOne() // Inserts a single document into a collection
