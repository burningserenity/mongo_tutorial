db == database

collection == collection of documents; use name of collection you're
querying. Any time a collection is referenced that doesn't exist, it will be
created.

If your database is books and your collection is george_orwell, you would do:
  
  use books
  db.orwell.method

To read a document, simply do:

  db.collection.find()

  db.collection.insertOne() // Inserts a single document into a collection

  db.collection.insertMany() // Inserts several documents into a collection
